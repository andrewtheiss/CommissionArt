Always verify contract methods exist before implementing them
Use existing utility functions in the codebase rather than reimplementing them
Check the actual contract ABIs to understand available methods
When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
Follow established patterns in the codebase
Do not use mock contracts for testing.  create real instances of each contract.

For Vyper Code:
We are using at least vyper version 0.4.1
External method signatures should be camelCase
Instance Variables should also be camelCase
Method Inputs should _be_underscore_delimited
