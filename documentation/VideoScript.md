--------------- COLLECTOR ----------------------------
Welcome to the most community-centric art commission hub on the web.  Commission. Art.  
We love curating art, and web3 has extracted some of the most talented artists and iconic 
art yet.  

So often collectors commission art pieces and off of existing NFTs.
**animate an art piece which is crafted from an NFT collection**

These piece are often associated with the piece, or collection, but there's no central location for tracking ownership, 
supporting artists and curating pieces. 

Also, when an NFT changes ownership, all the commissioned works are often lost or forgotten.  

**Show both artists and collectors**
Commission Art supports both curators and artists.

Curators can now keep track of all their commissions and they're tied directly to their NFT assets. When a 
new piece is purchased, its associated art follows with it.

Artists write their work directly on the blockchain and link them directly to
the original piece.  When the NFT transfers ownership, the pieces will follow with the commissioner always carrying 
with the piece.

---------------- ARTIST
Welcome to the most community-centric art commission hub on the web.  Commission. Art.  
We love artists.  Commission art is a artist-centric platform allowing artists increase their visibility and community support.

We do this in one of 2 ways.  
First off, commissioned pieces have the option to attach to the piece they are based off.  When a collector transfers the original
piece, the collected art goes with it.  This allows artists to broaden their visibility across collector profiles as
collectors curate pieces.  Don't worry, the credit is still given for the original artist and commissioner.

Also, if users like a profile or art piece, they can purchase a copy of the artist's piece minting it to their profile.

Lastly, Commission Art plans to be a commission-free platform which redirects every single bit of sales and profit
to the artist, with no commission.

In the highest ideals of web, code is immutable, decentralized, and no owner.  That means that artists get 100% of their subsequent mints, and the platform infrastructure exists directly on the blockchain forever.  

Our goal is to promote amazing art, reward artists, and create an ecosystem for distributing and supporting artists.

------ Commission Marketplace
Submit a proposal for a commission market.  This allows you to put a bid on a commission for a user.  This marketplace is an escrow-based commitment where the artist can accept any of the contracts for pieces.
