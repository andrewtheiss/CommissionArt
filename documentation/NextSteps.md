i need to create a mechanism to register art commission hubs in what is currently called the 'ownerregistry'. 
At the end of the day, the 'OwnerRegsitry'  also gets cross chain messages from the L2 and updates the correct owner of a artcommissionhubs on the L3.  This registry also is the focal point to lookup all different commissioned works which are registered, via their ArtCommissionHubs.  So if i want to update the owner of an art piece, i can call a method on the L1 which will propagate all the way down and relay to the 'OwnerRegistry' which will update the owner of that artCommissionHub. this way an ArtCommissionHub can always have the latest owner for ALL the commissioned works under a single contract/update.


When a user uploads a piece they have the option of saying that its a commission:
- if a collector uploads an art piece, they upload it as a collector (commissioner)
- if an artist uploads an art piece, they upload it as the artist (artist)

TODO: I need a simple 
TODO: There probably needs to be a method which allows the uploader to flag (upload as art I created, or uploade as a commission i got from someone else) just in case the rolls need to change for an upload or two.

TODO: figure out...
I need to grow the functionality here to handle both group commissions.  A group commission is a single artist who creates a single work what a group of people tagged in their work.  this will generally be saved as a myArt piece under a person, or perhaps create a artCommissionHub for an artist.  Does the code already handle that?

TODO: I need (after i figure out the answers to the above issues) to document that

TODO:
I need lastly to create a mechanism where on creating a profile, the user can also give the address of an ArtCommissionHub OR another user.  
I need a single transaction for any user interaction. 
User creates art piece on existing profile
User creates art piece on new profile, creating the profile and registering it
User create profile art piece and their profile
User creating an art piece with an associated profile who made the work (so it would be a commissioned work for the uploader but a unverified art piece for the artist).
 - Note: This would have to create a new profile for the artist as well if it doesn't exist
User creates commissioned work on a new profile.  This will create their profile, create a ArtCommissionHub for that work, register the Art as unverified to the ArtCommissionHub.



 registering the profile in the profile hub, registering the SECOND profile if the user destination address doesn't have a profile and you are registering a piece on someone else's profile, 

TODO: 
Last and finally i need a way for any number of ArtCommissionHubs to be associated with a profile.  When the ArtCommissionHub updates to a new user, i need that users profile to show all the recent art.  I also need the ArtCommissionHub of the previous owner to be unregistered as they no longer are the owner of the ACH work.  


To clarify contract purposes, I suggest the following renames:
OwnerRegistry → NFTOwnershipRegistry
Reflects its role in managing NFT ownership and hub registration across chains.

ArtCommissionHub → CommissionCollection
Indicates it’s a collection of commissioned works tied to an NFT or artist.

Profile → UserProfile
Clearly denotes it as a user’s profile with art and social features.

ProfileFactoryAndRegistry → ProfileRegistry
Emphasizes its role as the central registry for profiles.

ArtPiece → ArtWork
Simplifies and clarifies that it represents individual art pieces.


1. it should automatically unlink the hub as the hub links to the new owner's profile.
2. if the profile doesnt exist, i need to create the profile.  anyone can create a profile for anyone, but the profile account address remains the owner of that profile.  the profile will always be registered to the profile hub on creation.  also yes create the profile.
3. A group commission is actually a single commission done without a NFT-based ArtCommissionHub but a more generic ArtCommissionHub.  in reality a group commission is a single artist making an ArtPiece.  that artPiece has a bunch of tagged individuals.
There also is the need for a ArtCommissionHub which is owned by a 3rd party wallet , multisig, single account and chainId and not specifically attached to an NFT collection.  This needs to be addressed.
4. Yes, every time an ArtCommissionHub is created, it needs to be Registered.

5.  Also from a user and website standpoint, i need it so that you can see the latest commissions from your most recent NFT-associated ArtCommissionHub, so that when you buy a NFT, and update the owner in the owner registry and associated art CommissionHub, you can immediately query for the latest ArtCommissionHub which is attached to that Profile (and then grab the underlying art pieces)

Also I need to handle designing a page which is going to be most beneficial for users where every time the artist or user refreshes, it can grab a new block of art from across multiple ArtCommissionHubs.  This may be something like ->  Get Random 5 ArtCommissionHubs registered to me, grab 5-50 art pieces from each of those hubs (there are likely fewer than 5 for almost all hubs, so 5-50 is a very aggressive number), then grab the artPieces for each of those  

Also i need a way to see latest commissions both confirmed and unverified so that the homepage can show new art all the time.  


.
The OwnerRegistry.updateRegistration path can be reused to transfer ownership of generic hubs if needed. For example, if a DAO wants to transfer control of its hub to a new multisig, we could call OwnerRegistry._registerNFTOwner(chain_id, GENERIC_HUB_ADDRESS, hub_id, new_owner, msg.sender). This will invoke ArtCommissionHub.updateRegistration(chain_id, GENERIC_HUB_ADDRESS, hub_id, new_owner) to update the stored owner in the hub
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
. We would allow this only if msg.sender is authorized (likely the current owner or the hub itself calling via some admin function). The hub’s owner variable would update
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
, and the OwnerRegistry owners mapping would update accordingly.
Profile Integration: When a generic hub is created, we link it to the owner’s profile similar to NFT hubs:
In createGenericCommissionHub, after initializing the hub, call ProfileFactoryAndRegistry.hasProfile(owner). If true, get the profile and call Profile.addCommissionHub(hub_address) to list it on their profile (the ProfileFactoryAndRegistry address will be allowed to call this as set up earlier).
If the owner has no profile (e.g., a DAO contract with no profile or a user who hasn’t joined), we add the hub to the ownerToCommissionHubs[owner] mapping in OwnerRegistry for future reference (as described in section 1). So even non-profile owners have their hubs tracked.
The hub’s owner field is set to the provided owner address at deployment (by default, msg.sender in ArtCommissionHub’s __init__ was used
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
, but since we use initialize, we explicitly set it via updateRegistration call or directly in initialize for the newly created hub).
Generic Hub Usage: A generic hub can be used in the same way as an NFT hub:
The owner (or others if permitted) can call submitCommission(art_piece_address) on the hub to add art pieces. All the commission tracking (verifiedArt, unverifiedArt arrays, counts, events) works the same.
The difference is that the hub is not tied to an external NFT, it’s simply a collection of commissions under an owner’s control. For example, a DAO could create a generic hub to showcase art commissioned for the DAO’s community, or a user might create one to collect commissions not related to a specific NFT they own.
The chainId in the hub helps identify the context (for instance, a multisig on Ethereum might set chainId=1 to denote that origin).
By supporting generic hubs, we allow broader usage of the commission system:
Multi-signature wallets or DAO contracts (which are identified by an address) can directly own a hub and verify commissions. For instance, a DAO could be the “owner” that verifies commissioned artwork in its hub.
Users without any base NFT can still create a hub to receive commissions (this might overlap with simply using their profile’s commission list, but a hub provides the on-chain verification flows and separation of verified/unverified submissions).
Global Registry of ArtCommissionHubs
To facilitate discovery and indexing, all ArtCommissionHubs (NFT-based or generic) will be registered in a global list when created:
We will maintain a dynamic array allCommissionHubs: DynArray[address, 10**6] in the OwnerRegistry (or a separate registry contract). Each time a new hub is created, whether via an NFT owner registration or via createGenericCommissionHub, we append the hub’s address to this array.
An event GlobalHubRegistered(hub_address, chain_id, owner) will be emitted as well. (Note: We already emit ArtCommissionHubCreated with details
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
, which can serve a similar purpose. We can rely on that event for off-chain indexing of all hubs.)
Provide public view functions to query the global list:
getAllHubsCount() -> uint256 returns the total count of hubs in allCommissionHubs.
getHubsBatch(uint256 start, uint256 count) -> DynArray[address, 100] returns a slice of the global hubs list (up to a max of 100 per call, for example) for pagination.
Because storing potentially millions of addresses in an array is feasible but iteration is expensive on-chain, these view functions will allow clients or indexers to page through the list if needed. In practice, an off-chain indexer (like The Graph) would listen to the creation events to index hubs more efficiently, but the on-chain list ensures there is a single source of truth and can be used as a fallback.
Why a global registry? This makes it easy to retrieve or iterate over all hubs for site-wide features:
For example, a discovery page could query random hubs from this list.
It helps verify that a given hub address is recognized by the system (if an address isn’t in the registry, it’s not an official ArtCommissionHub).
Off-chain, one can quickly index all hubs by starting from index 0 and reading batches, or by processing events.
Chain separation: Because the registry includes a chain_id for each hub (in its stored data or events), if in the future multiple L3 instances or cross-chain commissions are considered, one could filter by chain. In our single L3 environment, all hubs reside on the same chain (Animechain L3), but chain_id might refer to the origin of the NFT or owner. All new hubs (NFT-based or generic) will call log ArtCommissionHubCreated(chain_id, nft_contract, token_id, commission_hub) in OwnerRegistry
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
, which we will use as the trigger to also append to allCommissionHubs. (For NFT-based hubs this already happens in _registerNFTOwner on first discovery of an NFT
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
; for generic, we will manually log a similar event.)
Profile Query Methods for CommissionHubs and Art Pieces
With the above structures in place, we will expose easy methods for profiles to retrieve their commission hubs and related artworks:
Listing a User’s CommissionHubs: We add a view function in the Profile contract:
python
Copy
Edit
@view
@external
def getCommissionHubs(_page: uint256, _page_size: uint256) -> DynArray[address, 100]:
    result: DynArray[address, 100] = []
    arr_len: uint256 = len(self.commissionHubs)
    if arr_len == 0 or _page * _page_size >= arr_len:
        return result
    start: uint256 = _page * _page_size
    count: uint256 = min(_page_size, arr_len - start, 100)
    for i in range(count):
        result.append(self.commissionHubs[start + i])
    return result
This mirrors the pattern of getCommissions for art pieces
file-wfykehh3qfpexfusv8wahe
. A profile’s “commission hubs” list will include all active NFT-based hubs the user owns and any generic hubs they created/own. The list is kept up-to-date by the linking/unlinking logic described earlier. A variant getRecentCommissionHubs(page, page_size) can also be provided to page from the end (most recently added hubs) similar to getRecentCommissions
file-wfykehh3qfpexfusv8wahe
file-wfykehh3qfpexfusv8wahe
. This helps if we want the “latest active” hubs easily:
“Latest active hubs” essentially means the newest hubs that the user acquired or created. Since we append on acquisition, the end of the list tends to have the latest ones. Even if a hub is removed due to transfer, our list removal swaps in another hub, slightly perturbing order. For a precise chronological list, we could timestamp each addition, but that’s overkill. Instead, we can assume the user doesn’t frequently transfer all hubs; the order is mostly reflective of acquisition order. For feed purposes, this is acceptable.
Querying Art Pieces in a Hub: Once a user has a hub address (from their profile or elsewhere), they can query that hub for art pieces:
Each ArtCommissionHub already provides methods getVerifiedArtPieces(start, count) and getUnverifiedArtPieces(start, count) to page through the stored commission lists
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
. We will ensure these can return up to a reasonable maximum (e.g. 1000 at a time as shown). For example, a call can fetch 50 verified art piece addresses starting at index 0, or fetch the next 50 by adjusting the start.
For convenience, we can add a function getRecentArtPieces(uint256 max_count) -> DynArray[address, N] on the hub that returns the last N art pieces regardless of verified/unverified status. However, mixing verified and unverified in one array might be confusing (since they are stored separately). More likely, the frontend will call both lists:
e.g., call hub.getVerifiedArtPieces(max(len_verified-5,0), 5) to get the last 5 verified pieces, and hub.getUnverifiedArtPieces(max(len_unverified-5,0), 5) for the last 5 unverified, then merge if needed.
Alternatively, rely on events to get chronological ordering (discussed in the next section).
We will update ArtCommissionHub.getLatestVerifiedArt(_count, _page) to allow up to 5 or more results (currently it’s hardcoded to return at most 3 addresses in a DynArray
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
). We can change the DynArray size to, say, 50 and use _count capped at 50 to return that many recent verified commissions in a circular buffer manner. This can be useful for quickly grabbing a few recent verified pieces without pagination math. Similarly, a getLatestUnverifiedArt(count) can be added if needed.
Fetching from Profile perspective: We might add a convenience method in ProfileFactoryAndRegistry such as getUserCommissionHubs(address user) -> address[] that simply calls the user’s profile getCommissionHubs. However, since one can get the profile via ProfileFactoryAndRegistry.getProfile(user)
file-ggw1p8gbe3fgpszi2n8ehn
 and then call the profile’s view function directly, that might be unnecessary duplication. The frontend or an indexer can perform those two calls. Still, for a simplified frontend call, ProfileFactoryAndRegistry could expose:
python
Copy
Edit
@view
@external
def getLatestHubsForUser(address user, uint256 max) -> DynArray[address, 10]:
    # returns up to `max` latest hubs (we can internally call Profile.getRecentCommissionHubs(0, max))
Similarly, we could add getAllHubsForUser(user) with pagination.
Commission/Art Queries: The Profile contract’s existing getCommissions(page, size) returns all commissions (art pieces) associated with that profile (whether as artist or commissioner)
file-wfykehh3qfpexfusv8wahe
. This is distinct from hubs – it’s per individual art pieces added via addCommission. A user can use getCommissions to see everything they’ve been involved in (each entry is an ArtPiece address). To get details of each piece (owner, artist, etc.), one could call the ArtPiece’s owner() or artist() views
file-durvxywyja1ymoujmrr7sa
file-durvxywyja1ymoujmrr7sa
.
In summary, profiles have two separate sets of data to query:
CommissionHubs list: which NFT hubs or generic hubs they own (essentially, containers of multiple commissions).
Commissions list (art pieces): individual commission NFTs they have either created or received. This list may include items also accessible through hubs (e.g., if they own an NFT hub, the pieces in that hub might also be in their commissions list if they added them). But commissions list also covers scenarios where they were the artist for someone else’s NFT (that piece might appear in their commissions list as an artist, even though the hub is owned by the other person).
These dual views allow a user to browse by project (hub) or see a flat list of all commissions.
Frontend Optimizations: Sampling, Batching, and Feeds
We will provide patterns and possibly dedicated methods to optimize common frontend queries, focusing on efficiency and pagination:
Random Sampling of Hubs per User (Homepage feed): If the homepage needs to show, say, 5 random commission hubs for a given user (perhaps to highlight a subset of their commissions):
The straightforward approach is to fetch the user’s full hub list (or the count of hubs) via Profile.getCommissionHubs and then randomly select 5 on the client side. However, if a user has a very large number of hubs, fetching all could be heavy. Instead, we can:
Use the commissionHubCount from the profile to know the total. Generate 5 random indices on the client (or a backend) within that range.
Call a small view function to fetch those specific hubs. We could implement a method getCommissionHubAt(index) -> address in the Profile contract for direct indexed access. Then the client can call that for each of the 5 chosen indices. Each call is O(1) on-chain to retrieve from the array.
Alternatively, slightly less random: use the getRecentCommissionHubs to get the last X hubs and then randomly pick among those. This biases toward newer hubs but is one on-chain call. Depending on the use case, truly uniform random might not be required.
On-chain randomness is limited; we will rely on off-chain selection for randomness. The key is efficient retrieval given an index or small range, which the above methods provide.
Alternative: We could create a specialized function that returns 5 random hubs in one call by using a pseudo-random seed (like block hash) to pick indices. However, this introduces unpredictability and potential miner influence. It’s simpler and more transparent for the frontend to handle random selection.
Fetching 5–50 Artworks per Hub: When displaying a hub’s page or a feed of artworks, the frontend often needs to load a batch of artworks from a hub (e.g., “Show 20 more pieces”).
The ArtCommissionHub.getVerifiedArtPieces(start, count)
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
 and analogous getUnverifiedArtPieces allow retrieving up to 1000 addresses in one call, which covers the 5–50 range easily. We will ensure that getUnverifiedArtPieces is updated to use a larger DynArray (currently it’s DynArray[address, 1] in the snippet
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
, likely a placeholder – we will change that to, say, 100 or 1000).
For hubs with fewer items than requested, these functions already handle that by bounding the count to the available items
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
. The returned array will simply be shorter than requested. The frontend can detect length and know it hit the end.
We will add a helper on the hub: getLatestArtPieces(uint256 n) that returns the last n commissions mixing verified and unverified. Implementation:
We can leverage the circular buffer latestVerifiedArt (which holds up to 300 of the most recent verified commissions)
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
 and also consider unverified ones. However, “latest” in terms of block time could intermix verified and unverified.
Simpler approach: since every submission emits an event with a timestamp (block), an off-chain service can actually sort by time. On-chain, we might not maintain a combined sorted list.
We might decide not to implement a combined list on-chain due to complexity; instead, provide separate latest queries for each category. The frontend can then merge if needed by comparing block timestamps of the events (it can fetch event logs for CommissionSubmitted for the hub).
In practice, for each hub page:
To get an initial load, call getVerifiedArtPieces(0, 20) and getUnverifiedArtPieces(0, 20). Display verified ones prominently and unverified (pending approval) separately or flagged.
Or call getLatestVerifiedArt(20) to get the 20 most recent verified
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
 and perhaps a similar getRecentUnverified(count) that we can add.
For subsequent loads (pagination), increment the start index or page number.
Homepage Mixed Feed (recent verified & unverified commissions across all hubs): A homepage may want to show a global feed of recently submitted commissions (whether verified or not) in the last N blocks, possibly with some filtering (like highlighting verified ones from notable collections, but also showing unverified new submissions).
Off-chain Indexer Approach: We will rely on an off-chain indexer (such as The Graph or a custom backend service) to aggregate events for this global feed:
All ArtCommissionHub contracts emit CommissionSubmitted(art_piece, submitter, verified) events when a new commission is added
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
. These events include verified=False for unverified submissions. Additionally, when an owner verifies an existing commission, a CommissionVerified(art_piece, verifier) event is emitted
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
.
By listening to these events across all hubs (the indexer can subscribe to the event signature on the entire blockchain), we can maintain a chronological list of commissions.
The indexer can store attributes like which hub, which profile (artist/submitter), verified status, block timestamp, etc.
To get the recent commissions feed, the frontend queries the indexer for the last X commissions (mixing verified and unverified). Because the indexer has them sorted by block time, this is straightforward.
The feed can then display each item with context: e.g., “New ArtPiece by Alice for Azuki #1234 (Verified)” or “Unverified commission submitted for Bob’s CoolCat NFT”.
We can mix verified and unverified as needed; perhaps highlight verified ones differently. The question specifically says “mix verified and unverified commissions across recent blocks,” so we will indeed show both, giving a real-time sense of activity.
On-chain alternative: It is theoretically possible to have a central contract on L3 receive notifications of new commissions (for example, OwnerRegistry could have a function that each hub calls on submission to log a global event or store in a ring buffer). However, this adds overhead to every commission submission (extra call) and complexity in storage. Given that off-chain solutions excel at this kind of aggregation, we choose not to duplicate this on-chain.
The L3 Indexer Node (or Graph node) can also apply any additional logic for the feed:
For instance, “mixing verified and unverified” might involve showing some proportion of each. If needed, the indexer could filter to ensure a balance (though likely we just show all sorted by time).
It can also join with profile data (so it can display user names or profile images if available by linking the submitter’s profile).
Pagination: The homepage feed can be paginated by time or index. E.g., fetch 20 most recent commissions, then 20 before that, etc., using timestamps or event indices as cursors. The indexer can provide an API for that. On-chain, doing such a query would be very inefficient (scanning potentially thousands of hubs).
Verified vs Unverified in Feeds: Verified commissions usually indicate the NFT owner approved the art. Unverified may just need review. The feed will likely label them, and possibly the homepage might want to favor verified commissions from popular collections for quality. Since the question hints at mixing them, we ensure the feed query doesn’t exclude unverified. We might, for example, show the latest 10 items, even if 7 are unverified and 3 verified, in chronological order. Or we could intermix from two lists. This is a presentation decision handled in the frontend or indexer; the on-chain data needed (events and status flags) is all available.
Caching Layers: For performance, the frontend should cache results of frequent calls:
User’s commission hubs list doesn’t change often, so it can be cached in memory or local storage once fetched, and updated when new events (like a transfer or creation) indicate a change.
Similarly, commission lists within hubs can be cached per hub and updated incrementally when new commissions come in (via events).
Using block numbers or timestamps from events can help avoid re-fetching everything on every page load.
Edge case logic for fewer items: As noted, all our pagination functions handle the case where the requested page or count exceeds the available items by returning an empty array or a shorter list
file-wfykehh3qfpexfusv8wahe
file-wfykehh3qfpexfusv8wahe
. The frontend should detect an empty result as end-of-list. If a hub has fewer than 5 artworks and the frontend tries to load 5, it will just get however many exist (say 3) – this is expected behavior.
In summary, front-end optimized queries will leverage:
Direct indexed access to arrays (for random access or small batches).
Paginated views (ensuring no single call returns unbounded data).
Off-chain aggregation for cross-hub feeds and random sampling, to avoid heavy on-chain computation.
TheGraph (or similar) to subscribe to contract events for real-time updates on new commissions and ownership transfers, which can then trigger UI updates (like removing a hub from one profile and adding to another in the app state when an OwnershipUpdated event
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
 is seen).
Cross-Chain State Synchronization (L1 → L2 → L3)
Finally, we ensure the architecture cleanly handles synchronization of state across L1, L2, and L3, especially for NFT-based commission hubs:
NFT Ownership Updates: The chain of custody for NFT ownership info is:
L1 Ethereum (or other L1): The actual NFT contract (e.g., an ERC-721 collection) emits transfers. Our L1QueryOwner contract can be called to query the owner on L1 and send that info to L2
file-j1sbtmc7y94qxhevwttgg4
file-j1sbtmc7y94qxhevwttgg4
.
L2 (Arbitrum): The L2 Relay (on e.g. Arbitrum) receives the L1 query result via receiveNFTOwnerFromCrossChainMessage
file-5ahheepddqhn5l9dufupsg
, then forwards it to the L3 OwnerRegistry by calling registerNFTOwnerFromParentChain(chainId, nftContract, tokenId, owner)
file-5ahheepddqhn5l9dufupsg
file-5ahheepddqhn5l9dufupsg
.
L3 (Animechain): The OwnerRegistry on L3 then invokes _registerNFTOwner internally
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
. This is exactly where our extended logic will update the CommissionHub’s owner and link/unlink profiles in the same transaction. The Registered event emitted from L3 OwnerRegistry will reflect the new owner and hub address
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
.
Atomicity: Because the cross-chain message triggers a single call on L3, our linking/unlinking in _registerNFTOwner is executed atomically within that call. So by the time the L3 transaction from the relay is done:
The OwnerRegistry’s owners mapping is updated,
The ArtCommissionHub’s owner variable is updated via updateRegistration call
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
,
The old owner’s profile (if any) is updated, and the new owner’s profile (if exists) is updated.
Thus, any front-end or indexer observing L3 events will see a consistent update. For instance, they’ll see OwnershipUpdated event from the hub contract
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
 showing the new owner, and they’ll see ProfileFactoryAndRegistry or Profile events if we emit any for linking. We can emit events like HubLinkedToProfile(user, hub) and HubUnlinkedFromProfile(user, hub) from ProfileFactoryAndRegistry when performing those actions for easier tracking.
Handling L2->L3 direct user actions: If the user initiates something on L2 that should reflect on L3 (for example, if there were an L2 marketplace for commissions, or if we store profiles on L2 as well – not in our case, profiles are only on L3), the L2 would use a similar retryable ticket mechanism to call L3’s ProfileFactoryAndRegistry or OwnerRegistry. Our contracts already include an L2Relay.relayToL3(...) for sending owner data to L3
file-5ahheepddqhn5l9dufupsg
file-5ahheepddqhn5l9dufupsg
. The same concept could be extended for profile or commission data if needed (though currently, all commission logic lives on L3).
Multi-Chain CommissionHubs: In case we ever have multiple L3s or sidechains, the chainId field in ArtCommissionHub and OwnerRegistry mapping keys allows distinguishing hubs from different source chains. For example, if in the future we had commission hubs tracking NFTs from Ethereum (chainId 1) and maybe another chain (chainId 137 for Polygon) concurrently, the mapping keeps them separate. Our linking logic uses the full tuple including chainId and contract, so it won’t mix up hubs from different chains.
Synchronization of Commission Verification: Commission verification (the NFT owner marking a commission as verified) is an L3 action (calling ArtCommissionHub.verifyCommission) – it does not need to propagate back to L1 or L2, as it’s only relevant to the commission system. The results (e.g., moving an item from unverified to verified list) are contained in L3 and reflected in events
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
. The NFT itself on L1 is not affected by commissions except as an off-chain value-add.
Off-Chain Indexing of Cross-Chain Data: We will use off-chain services to correlate data:
E.g., to display an NFT’s image or metadata on L3, the commission hub stores chainId, nftContract, tokenId. The front-end can use that to fetch the original NFT details from L1 (via an API or subgraph on Ethereum) if needed for context (like showing “Azuki #1234”).
Our system also emits L1ContractSet event on a hub if we ever link it to an L1 contract address (the code has setL1Contract in ArtCommissionHub
file-syit3bfprksmahnrbfr593
). This could be used to record the L1 collection address for the NFT for UI reference.
Consistency and Race Conditions: The design assumes the cross-chain messages for ownership come in order. If an NFT rapidly transfers on L1, multiple retryable tickets to L3 might arrive out of order. However, OwnerRegistry’s logic will simply update to the latest one. The profile linking will likewise adjust to the final owner accordingly (each update unlinking the previous, linking the new). The lastUpdated timestamp mapping in OwnerRegistry
file-fmzu8fdbvzeeb9dx8lx5hc
 can be used to ignore stale updates if needed (we can compare and only update if the incoming timestamp is newer than stored, ensuring eventual consistency).
L3 to L2 (or L1) communications: Currently, we do not send anything back to L2/L1 except through events. Profiles and commissions live solely on L3 for now, which simplifies matters. If in future, one wanted to reflect some reputation or token on L1 for completed commissions, that would require additional bridging logic (out of scope here).
Off-Chain Indexer Recap: We strongly recommend using an off-chain indexer for:
Aggregating global events (for feeds, leaderboards, etc.).
Resolving data that isn’t efficient on-chain (like searching which hubs a user owns if they have no profile – our ownerToCommissionHubs helps on-chain, but an indexer can also invert the mapping easily).
Joining cross-chain data (linking L1 NFT metadata with L3 commission records).
The combination of on-chain automatic linking and off-chain indexing provides a robust, real-time view of the system:
The moment an NFT is bought on L1, the owner’s profile on L3 (if exists) is updated within one cross-chain transaction to reflect the commission hub transfer.
The moment an artist submits a commission, an event on L3 is emitted and the piece is immediately queryable via the hub contract for verification status and via profile for their own list.
The indexer sees these events and updates the feed/queries that drive the UI, ensuring that the frontend can be both fresh and snappy (by serving pre-queried results) and consistent with on-chain state (thanks to the atomic transactions we designed).
By adhering to these architectural choices, we satisfy all the requirements:
Automatic profile linking/unlinking on ownership changes,
One-shot profile + art creation flows (with optional other-party profile creation),
Support for non-NFT commission hubs for any owner entity,
A unified registry for all hubs,
Easy querying of a user’s active hubs and their art pieces,
High-performance retrieval patterns for front-end use (random sampling, batch loading, recent feeds),
Cross-chain synchronization that keeps L3 in lockstep with L1 NFT state while providing a seamless experience on the application layer.

✅ Outcome: One-step profile and art creation experience.
🛠️ Step 4: Generic (Non-NFT) CommissionHub Support
Goal: Support ArtCommissionHubs owned by multisigs, DAOs, or individual wallets.

Update OwnerRegistry:

Introduce a constant GENERIC_HUB_ADDRESS (e.g., 0x0000...01).

Method: createGenericCommissionHub(chain_id, owner)

Handle non-NFT-based hubs creation.

Profile integration:

Auto-link to profiles on creation, similar to NFT hubs.

✅ Outcome: Flexible, generic commission hubs enabled.
🛠️ Step 5: Global Registry & Indexing Support
Goal: Create global visibility into all commission hubs.

Maintain global registry:

Add allCommissionHubs: DynArray[address, 10^6].

Emit events for off-chain indexing.

Off-chain Indexer Setup (Recommended):

Utilize The Graph or a similar indexing solution.

Index hub creation, linking/unlinking events, and commission submissions.

✅ Outcome: Centralized hub visibility and efficient querying.
🛠️ Step 6: Frontend-Friendly Query Enhancements
Goal: Efficient frontend queries for hubs and art.

Extend contracts:

Add paginated & direct index methods for hubs/artworks.

Provide batch-loading functions (5–50 items per call).

Off-chain feed creation:

Setup indexer API endpoints for random hub sampling and recent commission feeds.

Frontend caching strategy:

Cache query results locally (sessions) and invalidate upon events.

✅ Outcome: Optimized frontend queries for responsive UI.
🛠️ Step 7: Cross-Chain (L1 → L2 → L3) Integration Testing
Goal: Ensure robust cross-chain synchronization.

Test flow end-to-end:

Transfer NFTs on L1.

Validate correct updates propagate to L3 profiles/hubs via L2Relay.

Confirm atomic updates and consistent on-chain states.

✅ Outcome: Reliable cross-chain synchronization and data consistency.
